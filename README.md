VT is codename for project "Vietra Galaxy" & "VTworld"
The VRChat world is named Crash Island

The character Vietra Galaxy is a science fiction character used in VRChat. (VT is its codename and translates to Vetra).
Crash Island is a world made by me that is now complete, the world features many easter eggs from my original project "Lonely Road". One of the biggest references is Monument Island.
The version log is available to be viewed here.
