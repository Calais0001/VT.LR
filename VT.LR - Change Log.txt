			Version: Alpha 0.1 | First Release
			Release Date: 9/5/2018
	
		Changes:

	- Begun sculpting terrain - mountain and flat plane
	 *the terrain will most likely be not complete in this update and will be worked on more 
	in later versions
	- Added water shader that supports VR (TEST)
	 *water is very heavily fine-tuned for world setting, current shader settings may change
	in the future
	 *the shader has been tested in VR and has passed.
	- Added skybox
	- Added the jump mechanic
	 *jump power is 3
	- Textured terrain with over 15+ different Ground_textures
	 *currently incomplete
	
	
		Here comes the first update to this new VRChat world! at the moment I have no name 
		for it so for now we'll call it Lonely Road 2. And yes it's Lonely Road TWO.
		The first was made in Roblox and was a big project back in 2013-2015, but only this
		year I have officially ended the development due to inactivity/faults and many 
		other issues.
		
		To understand more about why this world has this link go visit the 
		VT-LR Concept Plan, you can also find out the concept on this world and what it
		may become in the future and the plans i have for it.

			Version: Alpha 0.2 | Graphical implementations / Terrain
			Release Date: 9/7/2018
			
		Changes:

	- Added rain
	 *heavy work needs to be completed on this + 100% not performance checked
	- Added Volumetric ray-traced clouds
	 *very intensive on GPU - due to this it has been disabled until I can make it
	  performance friendly (refer to change log description)
	- More work on the terrain texturing
	 *considered complete at this stage
	- Slight optimizations to the ocean shader
	 *it now appears much better with the lighting/stormy setting, also the parallax
	  has been greatly improved for wide and high stormy waves without creating ugly
	  spikes.
	- Partially completed terrain grass textures
	 *colors and appearance may be incorrect, more testing and editing is to be completed
	- KNOWN ISSUE: at load time the rain particle system appears to spawn the particles
	  then halt then begin again, this issue is unknown at this time.
	
		
	This update has roughly a weeks worth of work. Many changes have been made including
	performance optimizations, terrain texture and form changes, additions such as volumetric 
	clouds and many more.
	
	At this moment the volumetric clouds have been disabled due to heavy performance drops
	whilst running the game in VR mode. Until I can add a local graphics control panel for 
	users to toggle various graphical enhancements within the game I will re-enable them,
	this goes for any other visual effects that I will include in the final version.

			Version: Alpha 0.3 | Terrain Updates / Deep End
			Release Date: 9/11/2018	
	
		Changes:

	- Fixed the grass having some strange green line at the top of the texture
	 *used an editor program
	- Disabled billboard mode for grass
	 *meaning it does not follow the camera
	- Edited global_lighting and specular mapping
	 *terrain and any outdoor objects now emit specularity as if it were wet
	- Added rocks near the shoreline
	 *more work on this
	- Added more different types of grass to the scene
	- Water shader visual graphics have been tweaked
	 *waves were big but appeared as if the player was incredibly tiny - this is a work
	  in progress + the search for a better water shader is in progress
	- Work on more efficient and diverse rain particle system has begun

	
	Finally! this version introduces more realistic and complex shaders + all outdoor
	objects now contain specularity.
	
	Soon i will begin searching for a more complex ocean shader but for now (due to
	VRChat blocking scripts) we're stuck with the shader we have.

			Version: Alpha 0.4 | Beta Elements / PS improvements
			Release Date: 9/19/2018	
	
		Changes:

	- Updated water shader
	 *more continuous changes will happen until I think this shader appears perfect for
	 the scene
	- Begun working on Beta version elements
	 *progress on a cabin featuring unity cloth script
	 *added a spaceship and picked a rough location for it
	- Global_lighting temperature value is now 10200
	- Optimised a few textures and reduced their sizes
	- Fixed global lighting bias issues
	- Ocean shader blending completely removed
	 *since V0.3 its been playing up so I have decided to make it just a straight height
	 map and normal map with cubemap reflections
	- Added a massive cloud particle system behind the mountain
	 *a hint to what might come? hmm..
	- Small optimizations to the rain particle system
	 *trying to make this performance friendly as much as I can
	- Grouped all scene objects
	 *this is purely to help with development - no performance improvements
	- Experimentation with flares
	 *beta element
	- oceanShaderBlending has been disabled **

	
	So since version 0.3 alpha the water shader has been playing up and I've even gone to
	the extent of moving my whole scene to a new project but alas have failed. the issue 
	persists and often fixes itself and then breaks again. this version it seems to be
	working so blending has been re-activated but do keep in might this world may end up
	with no ocean shader..
	
	Secondly this may be the last or second last update for Alpha as i'm working on beta 
	elements now. these new elements wont be in the alpha release of the game but will be
	when beta goes live!
	
	Finally the new particle systems such as Rain & Clouds are most likely not able to be
	ran	on low end machines. i have a i7 7700k 1080ti setup and run the map fine at 90fps.

			Version: Alpha 0.5 | Perfomance Improvements / Bug Fixes
			Release Date: 9/20/2018
			
		Changes:

	- Revisioned the cabin roof
	 *I am 83% with the total appearance of this cabin
	- Fixed heavy performance drop from candles
	 *changed from realtime to baked mode
	- The front door of the cabin no longer has a collider?
	- Removed spherical mirror in the bucket
	 *anything but using a quad mesh breaks the mirror
	- the light emitted from the bucket is now baked
	- fixed another collider issue with the cloth sheets in the cabin
	- fixed candle fire scale
	- adjusted cloth script solverFrequency
	 *solverFrequency = 160 (standard for moving objects) 60 (near still objects)
	- ocean shader performance optimizations
	 *tessellationStrength = 15 (originally 64)
	 *tessellationFarCap = 350 (originally 2500)
	- changed a few terrain texture sizes on their x, y axis
	- grass now appears denser
	- modified movement speed
	 *walk speed set to 2.4 and run speed set to 4.5
	- Draw distance set lower for terrain
	 *to help your hardware from rendering everything way over there
	
	
	This FINAL version for alpha is set to improve performance for older machines + squish
	a whole bunch of pesky bugs!
	
	Now, this is the best time to move onto bigger things! 
	Beta will include objects and props such as finishing the cabin, starting on the crashed
	space plane and Monument Island.
	
	All soon I shall reveal the plans I have for Beta.

			Version: Beta 1.0 | Perfomance Improvements / Bug Fixes / New OceanShader
			Release Date: 9/23/2018	
			PRE RELEASE - 1
	
		Changes:

	- BRAND NEW WATER SHADER !
	 *old water shader is now layer 2
	 *new water shader is now layer 1
	 *if you notice that the new ocean shader disappears on the side of your scream it's
	  meant to do this.
	- Revisioned the cabin roof
	- Added effects/ lighting to the space plane
	 *more is to be completed on this
	- Done more terraforming tweaks to the terrain system
	- Added extra details
	 *such as cliff rocks, tree/s, and more grass
	- Improved performance within the cabin
	 *texture sizes, 

	 
	This update brings forward a brand new stylish water shader, with much more controls,
	amazing new appearances and graphics. No more bugs and blend errors!
	
	This update also introduces the hard-worked cabin and the spaceplane.
	Plus the completed version of the rain particle system.
	
	More information will soon be released of the plans for beta in the Concept Plan.
	
	Beta 1.0 is a Pre-Release update and is not complete, consider this release as an open
	beta.

			Version: Beta 1.0 | Ocean Shader / Fixes
			Release Date: 9/23/2018	
			PRE RELEASE - 2
	
	
	*This update only releases fixes/ changes to the ocean shader
	
	
	Pre-Release 2 introduces a slight change to the way the new ocean shader will be used
	(including the old shader)
	Firstly I would like to say that the new ocean shader is not VR compatible. sorry.
	
	Now the old shader can be used for players in VR or Desktop (no limits). by default 
	the old shader will be active BUT using a panel that will be soon implemented will
	allow the players too switch between both shaders.
	
	For now, the new ocean shader has been disabled and until I can make a Graphics Panel for
	the world.

			Version: Beta 1.0 | World Size Compression / Release of BETA
			Release Date: 9/25/2018	
			PRE RELEASE - 3
	
		Changes:

	- Compressed all textures using Crunch Compression
	 *this will significantly improve load times
	- The new tree now waves in the wind
	- Added 3 buttons that allow players to improve client sided performance
	 *Buttons toggle rain system and clouds
	 *there is also a button that switches between the new ocean shader and the old one
	  be warned this may cause heavy lag whilst it switches
	- Added photoshoot pictures of LR
	 *these are original photos taken directly in the Roblox Studio
	- Both ocean shaders have been visually improved especially the old shader
	 *no longer appears as if the player is tiny in a massive ocean
	 *performance improvements with the new shader
	- Partial implementation of LOD groups
	 
	 
	Hooray! beta pre-release stages are over and this means beta is now live!
	 
	Some release highlights of beta brings a couple new features and content!  and lots
	of fixing..
	
	One of those features is that you are now able to toggle the Rain, Clouds and even
	switch between the new and old ocean shader!
	 
	Secondly, this update completes the cabin! with its secrets plus the spaceplane and a
	few other little things.
	
	Almost all the objects within the world now have partially working LOD groups
	(this feature is half implemented)
	
	The world size has dropped a whopping 250+ Megabytes! Crunch compression has been
	introduced as well as mesh compression to assist
	
	Finally, I am aware that sadly the new ocean shader is NOT VR compatible, thus why i 
	went to the extent of implementing buttons too switch between them, please also take 
	note that switching between shaders will temporarily freeze your client.
	
	My plans for beta will be added into the Concept plan within the next few days so keep
	your eyes peeled over there.

			Version: Beta 1.1 | Terrain Tweaks / Object Tweaks / Mountain Completion
			Release Date: 9/26/2018	
	
		Changes:

	- Unity Fog!
	 *this was delayed for a while but now has been added finally
	- Removed grass that clips through the cabin
	 *there still might be some, I can't remove 100% of it
	- The grass is a lot thinner
	 *may help with motion sickness/performance
	- Tweaks/ changes to the terrain around the mountain
	 *texture changes, heightmap changes, object adjustments, mesh compression. etc
	 *jagged or sharp points have also been smoothed out around the map
	- Lowered the tessellation strength on the galaxy balls
	 *increases performance at the cost of quality, which isn't very noticeable
	- Adjusted the performance throttler
	 *made easier to reach the buttons for VR users
	 *buttons now have specialized cube maps for what they do
	- Removed the player speed mode
	

	This update features the near completion of the mountain plus a bunch of small
	fixes in and around the map plus Unity Fog! not much to say about it... its fog.
	
	The new performance throttler was rushed in the first beta release so I've
	taken the time to improve it slightly, each button now has its own cubemap to 
	an attempt at giving away what it does. Such as, The bright blue underwater one 
	changes between the two ocean shaders, the second one with the default skybox is
	the rain system and finally the clouds button toggle's the clouds
	
	One last thing is that the clouds will soon be revamped and re-done for M.I, this 
	means it has been disabled and the button has been removed from the game.
	Until M.I is released the clouds will reappear.

			Version: Beta 1.2 | Performance/Visual Improvements / M.I Preperation
			Release Date: 9/28/2018	
	
		Changes:

	- Each Perf Thottler button now have they're own spinning icons above
	 *the button that switches between the 2 shaders has a heavy load icon due to load time
	 *the rain system toggler has a rain cloud with lightning
	 *the clouds system (temporarily removed) has a clouds icon
	- World barriers have now been implemented to prevent players from travelling outside
	  the map
	- Occlusion has been enabled
	 *It prevents objects from being rendered if you cannot see them behind other
	  static objects
	- Final Gather has been enabled also improving visual graphics
	- Lightmap settings adjusted
	- Ambient occlusion has been completely disabled
	 *VRChat does not handle AO correctly so it has been disabled to improve performance
	- Adjusted the Environment Lighting Intensity Multiplier
	 *set to 0.52
	- KNOWN ISSUE: The main directional light appears too make all shadows in the
	  scene flicker (THIS HAS BEEN FIXED)
	  
	  
	This update releases a bunch of changes to the lightmap settings, Final gather,
	Occlusion and a patch for the directional light (VT-LR#0001).
	
	The changes will improve performance and visual effects PLUS my knowledge on these
	before unseen tools have given me the ability to learn more about Unity and what it
	can do.
	
	The next update will be a while as i am now prepping to begin work on.. M.I
	To find out what M.I is check the concept plan, bits and pieces are mentioned but
	no real information has been leaked yet!

			Version: Beta 1.3 | World Size Compression System / New Features / M.I
			Release Date: 10/14/2018	
	
		Changes:

	- Significantly reduced the worlds download size
	 *a better compression system has been introduced using HQ and LQ materials
	- Added VRC mirror
	 *can be found not far from the spaceship
	- Changed the ocean shader button icon to a wave symbol
	 *good news is that the implementation of occlusion culling has fixed the major lag
	  spike when loading between the two ocean shaders
	- Fixed the big tree's colliders
	 *was set to Is Trigger by accident
	- Added reflection probes where necessary
	- Ocean shader render distances lowered due to Unity Fog
	 *thankfully unity fog obscures both shaders at a distance
	- Improved randomness and synchronization of the space plane's effects
	 *added engine hum audio source
	 *when sparks collide with the terrain they now lose 0.4 lifetime
	- Cabin radio now has static noise
	- Specular reflections changed slightly
	- All rocks now have a new detail texture
	
	This version introduces a system to help combat the world size issue, Several new
	features for distant or up close models now include HQ or LQ materials plus mesh
	compression. I've also taken the time to individually adjust the crunch compression
	settings on every texture loaded in the game.
	
	Progress on Monument Island has continued, at this moment a silhouette of the island
	can only be seen.. But soon players will be able to travel M.I once complete.

	Version 1.3 Beta also includes the VRCmirror, Smaller world size, Lighting corrections,
	PS improvements
